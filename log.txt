        '3Ô∏è‚É£ - Even though it is a minimalistic routine time-wise there is still a lot of variety. This is important to prevent boredom and stagnation. There are a number of unique exercises and techniques I haven‚Äôt used in any of my other programs! For most exercises we will be doing just 1-3 hard sets, so we have to make them count!\n' +

        '\n' +
        '3Ô∏è‚É£ - Even though it is a minimalistic routine time-wise there is still a lot of variety. This is important to prevent boredom and stagnation. There are a number of unique exercises and techniques I haven‚Äôt used in any of my other programs! For most exercises we will be doing just 1-3 hard sets, so we have to make them count!\n' +
